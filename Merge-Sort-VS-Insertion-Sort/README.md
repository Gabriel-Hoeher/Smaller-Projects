# Merge-Sort-VS-Insertion-Sort

This was an assignment where I was tasked with comparing the total amount of operations between merge and insertion sort functions

It compares by generating a random array determined by the size from 10 to 1000000 incrementing by 10

This is written in Java and is run through the file SortingDriver.java
